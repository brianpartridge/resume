# Resume

## Description
This repository contains the current draft of my resume and my attempt at writing a pretty LaTeX document.

## Usage
I do my editing in [LaTex Lab](http://docs.latexlab.org), since LaTeX is a pretty huge install.

## Thanks
[Scott Frazer](https://github.com/scottfrazer) for providing me with a starting point with LaTeX.
